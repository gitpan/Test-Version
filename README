NAME
    Test::Version - Check to see that version's in modules are sane

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::More;
            use Test::Version;

            # test blib or lib by default
            version_all_ok;

            done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
    This module's goal is to be a one stop shop for checking to see that
    your versions across your dist are sane. It currently checks to see that
    all Perl Modules have a VERSION defined, and that it is a valid VERSION
    by the rules of the "is_lax" function in version.

METHODS
    "version_ok( $filename, [ $name ] );"
        Test a single ".pm" file by passing a path to the function. Checks
        if the module has a version, and that it is valid with "is_lax".

    "version_all_ok( [ $directory, [ $name ]] );"
        Test all modules in a directory with "version_ok". By default it
        will check "blib" or "lib" if you haven't passed it a directory.
